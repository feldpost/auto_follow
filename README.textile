A very simple ruby script (using twitter4r) that will automatically follow your Twitter followers. It supports multiple twitter accounts. Currently, it's probably best to just run it as a cron job.

h3. Dependencies

	mbbx6spp-twitter4r >= 0.3.1

h3. Configuration

Set-up one or multiple accounts in @./config/accounts.yaml@:

	username: password

Use ./config/blacklist.yml to enter a list of twitter usernames that should not be auto-followed. Should you already follow any black-listed users, they will be automatically unfollowed. 

h3. Usage:
	
	ruby ./auto_follow.rb
