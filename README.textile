A very simple ruby script (using twitter4r) that will automatically follow your Twitter followers. It supports multiple twitter accounts. Currently, it's probably best to just run it as a cron job.

h3. Dependencies

	mbbx6spp-twitter4r >= 0.3.1

h3. Configuration

Rename both *yml.sample* files in @config/@:

	@cp config/accounts.yml.sample config/accounts.yml@
	@cp config/blacklist.yml.sample config/blacklist.yml@

Set-up one or multiple accounts in @./config/accounts.yaml@:

	username: password

Use @./config/blacklist.yml@ to enter a list of twitter usernames that should not be auto-followed. Should you already follow any black-listed users, they will be automatically unfollowed. 

h3. Usage
	
	@ruby ./auto_follow.rb@
	
h3. Notes

While auto_follow searches through complete list of pages for friends and followers, I'm not sure how well it will perform once you get into really high follower counts (5000+)
